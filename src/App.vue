        This is a simple Enigma machine simulator. It is not a perfect replica of the original machine, but it is close enough to be useful for learning about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This replicates the Wermacht I (or the Enigma I) machine, which was used by the German military during World War II. It is a three-rotor machine, with a reflector and a plugboard. The rotors are interchangeable, as well as the reflector (despite it was not that common to do so since it took a long time).
      </p>

      <p>
        I used this <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/index.htm" target="_blank">excellent resource</a> to learn about the machine and to build this simulator, the logo is also a courtesy of them (with an addition of a metal gradient border by me). And the code is heavily inspired on the professor <a href="http://github.com/mikepound">Mike Pound's</a> version of the Enigma machine, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/mikepound/enigma" target="_blank">here</a>.

/**
 * The global state approach is not the best option in the case of any app
 * however, since this is a single machine I could chose from two options:
 * - Use a global state like this and have a single source of truth, therefore
 *   the application itself represents the Enigma machine and the state is declared
 *   in the topmost component (this one)
 * - Use a local state and make the application create a new machine every time
 *   the configuration changes, this would be a better approach if we had multiple
 *   machines and we wanted to keep the state of each one of them like other sims
 *   since this only emulates Enigma I this is not needed
